## Background
Through taking a third year operating systems course (CPEN 331) at UBC, I implemented the kernel infrastructure for a teaching operating system, called OS161. This includes  synchronization primitives, processes and file tables, system calls and virtual memory. A barebones template repository was given to us, so I first had to understand how to navigate the source code and then implement the main logic.
