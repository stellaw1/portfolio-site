## Background

Through taking a third year operating systems course (CPEN 331) at UBC, I implemented the kernel infrastructure for a teaching operating system, called OS161. This includes synchronization primitives, processes and file tables, system calls and virtual memory. A barebones template repository was given to us, so I first had to understand how to navigate the source code and then implement the main logic.

## How I built it

1. OS161 is a simplified skeleton of a modern operating system. It comes with a configurable build system, code for some useful user-level utilities that can be run from within OS161, and code for the operating system itself. I first looked through the files to understand how the code is structured, what goes where, and how things work.
2. I then got familiar with how to use the GDB debugger to diagnose bugs and analyze the program.
3. I then implemented locks that provide mutual exclusion and condition variables with Mesa semantics without busy-waiting (using spinlocks) [commit](https://github.com/stellaw1/os161-amir-stella/releases/tag/asst2-submit)
4. I then solved a synchronization problem named [AirBalloon](https://github.com/stellaw1/os161-amir-stella/blob/master/kern/synchprobs/airballoon.c#L31) using the implemented locks [commit](https://github.com/stellaw1/os161-amir-stella/releases/tag/asst3-submit)
5. Then, I paired up with a partner to implement a list of system calls for our kernel

-   [open()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/open.html) - open a file
-   [read()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/read.html) - read data from file
-   [write()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/write.html) - write data to file
-   [lseek()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/lseek.html) - change current position in file
-   [close()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/close.html) - close file
-   [dup2()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/dup2.html) - clone file handles
-   [chdir()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/chdir.html) - change current directory
-   [\_\_getcwd()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/__getcwd.html) - get name of current working directory (backend)

6. Then, we implemented a few more system calls for handling user processes, address spaces, userspace, file table synchronization, etc.

-   [getpid()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/getpid.html) - get process id
-   [fork()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/fork.html) - copy the current process
-   [execv()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/execv.html) - execute a program
-   [waitpid()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/waitpid.html) - wait for a process to exit
-   [\_exit()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/_exit.html) - terminate process

7.  Lastly, we implemented a virtual memory system for the kernel by adding paging, TLB faults, and the [sbrk()](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~os161/man/syscall/sbrk.html) system call, so that `malloc()` works

## Technologies

-   C
-   GDB
-   Vim

## What I learned

Through this course I learnt a lot about the logic behind how an operating system works, especially about memory and synchronization handling. I became more proficient in reading and writing code in C and tools for developing in C, such as Vim and GDB.
