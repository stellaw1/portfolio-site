So this is my twenties...

Sometimes I feel like it will never sink in that I am 22 years old, but sometimes I feel like I have lives 50 years already because life moves so fast. So much growth and change has happened in my life and in those around me.

This is such an exciting time of our lives. Everyone is doing their best and living the lives that they dreamed of. Whether its building their dream career, meeting their forever person, or moving to their dream city. Everyone is working hard to build the lives that they are content with. Everyone is finding theirselves and finding the poeple they want around. Some are building their personality while others are building their dream home or even planning their dream wedding already. Everyone is at different places going at different paces. And that's such a scary but exciting thing. Most of us have no big responsibilities and have the luxury of making selfish decisions.

So what do I want to do with my life? That is the question that haunts us all. Now is the time to be saving money but also be travelling the world because you gotta live while you're young (but also like how am i supposed to afford a house if I don't start saving up now while I have no responsibilities) ANYWAYS there's a lot of doubt and confusion in this age but also very much excitement!!

Here are a few concrete guides that I realized to use to navigate my twenties:

-   career: work hard, climb the ladder, and don't lose my personality along the way! Take breaks! Balance is key
-   family: treasure them, spoil them, spend time with them, make sure to communicate how much I love and appreciate them
-   friends: appreciate the precious time that we have together. Soak in every memory and document whatever you can without costing the moment
-   relationship: be fearless and put yourself out there, but remember your worth! might as well be single if being with someone else isn't going to add to my life
-   hobbies: celebrate creativity and learning new things! These are the things that make up your personality and help build connections with others.

I think one good rule of guidance is to ask yourself: if you had no responsibilities and did not have to worry about making a living, what would you do with your life? For me, I would love to either read all of the books in the world or try to see every animal that exists in the world like a pokemon trainer checking off each species in my pokedex. It's all a balance right. Some days I work really hard and am staring at a computer screen from the moment I wake up to sunset with no breaks, but I do that so that in my time off I have the finances to experience everything I wish to with the people that I love.

Honestly your twenties is just making a series of decisions that have short term and long term effects on your life. For those that choose to put for time/ effort/ money into investing in an easier life in the future (whether in terms of finances, real estate, significant others or otherwise) that just means they have to work a little harder make more sacrifices now. Versus those that are living it up and spending every last dollar of their paycheck now are making great memories at a time where their mind and body are at the peak. There is no wrong way to live your twenties. Everyone gets to decide how they want to do it. We all have ups and downs and can't help compare sometimes, but we really need to be confident in our decisions. Let go of the idea that we need to live a perfect life by achieving X by Y years old. Let go of the mindset that we can only find happiness if we have X, Y and Z. I have accepted that there is no "perfect balance" or "permanent happiness". Every decision you make is a good one and every mistake is a lesson learnt. So just be happy with the way life is :) be happy with the poor decisions you have made along the way. Be happy with the embarrassing moments or time wasted on shitty people. Stop standing around complaining about things that are in your control, instead at least work towards improving it. Stop waiting for the perfect time to learn that new hobby that you've always wanted to try but "never had the time". Go out and experience all the good and bads of the world and grow as much as you can while you still can. Soak it all up. Meet all the people you have the pleasure of getting to know. Actively listen to their stories and spread the lessons you have learnt along the way to them!

What I want to see from myself before I turn 23:

-   Give as much effort as you are willing to to schoolwork and soak up what you can about interesting topics that courses are offering you
-   say yes! to the new activiites, to the new people, and to the new places
-   prioritize health before it's too late. Take care of your posture, taking breaks, me days, and use marathon training and intramurals as a good excuse to keep up with fitness
-   Make the first move, ask the deep questions, talk about feelings and goals and controversial topics that make friends uncomfy. Connections are what strong relationships are built upon
-   Learn! Learn anything and everything. Dig into the things that interest you and work on projects that you are passionate about. Please do not ever let your brain go dormant.
-   Express creativity! Be unafraid to show parts of yourself to those you are comfortable sharing with. Channel your finsta and try to use photography and videography to build a story of what you are tyring to express

This was a 22 year old's poor attempt to group her thoughts into words while still figuring them out. I'm not sure what is trying to be conveyed here, but thought I would document a small part of the process of me figuring out life. Life is good! far from perfect but it's good! and it's fine if it's not good because we will work hard to make it good!
