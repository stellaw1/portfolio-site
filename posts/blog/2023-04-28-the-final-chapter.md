Some feelings simply cannot be put into words, but somehow a playlist can describe it perfectly:

I remember watching Elliot Choy's college graduation [video](https://youtu.be/dGV9Vif4Twc) last year and this song coming on. At the time I thought wow when I graduate I want to make a video reminiscing all the memories, struggles, and growth that happened throughout the 5 years of my university journey. Now that that time has come, it's incredibly difficult to put into words what this feels like. Bittersweet doesn't even begin to describe it. There is so much more bitter than sweet (at least for now) becuase it feels like the end of something good rather than the beginning of something new.

Tell me have you seen a sunset turn into a sunrise

I have learnt an immense amount in an academic sense and about myself. So much growth happened in the past 5 years. I learnt through hardship, through experiences, and through my peers.

We made incredible memories which I will treasure forever. Many new experiences and traditions were made. I truly hope that this isn't the end of the journey for all my friendships, despite the fact that everyone is diverging into different routes where life takes them. The friends truly made it the best 5 years of my life. They somehow made the toughest studying and most mundance courses a fun time. How do I make sure they know just how much impact they have had on my life and just how much I appreciate each and every one of them.

Thank you for the happiest 5 years of my life.

I hope to capture all our best undergrad memories, however, difficult it is to put into words/ a video. The pain I feel from thinking about letting it all go and from having to say goodbye to my people proves how deep a connection was made. As difficult as it was to say goodbye to all my most treasured friends today and watch it sink in that the bonfire is likely the last occasion where every single one of us will be in the same place again, I am confident that this is not the last I will see of them. I'm so excited to see everyone achieve all their goals and dreams and keep in touch with them.

can't wait for the excitement of something new to hit after the sadness all sinks in and passes. 
PS. do not watch Violet Evergarden, Thirty Nine, or How to Train your dragon without expecting to sob
