Some feelings simply cannot be put into words, but somehow a playlist can describe it perfectly:

I remember watching Elliot Choy's college graduation [video](https://youtu.be/dGV9Vif4Twc) last year and this song coming on. At the time I thought wow when I graduate I want to make a video reminiscing all the memories, struggles, and growth that happened throughout the 5 years of my university journey. Now that that time has come, it's incredibly difficult to put into words what it actually feels like. Bittersweet doesn't even begin to describe it. There is so much more bitter than sweet (at least for now) becuase it feels like the end of something good rather than the beginning of something new.

I have learnt an immense amount in an academic sense and in a personal sense, through hardship, experiences, and peers.

We made incredible memories which I will treasure forever. Many new experiences and traditions were made. I truly hope that this isn't the end of the journey for all my friendships, despite the fact that everyone is diverging into different routes where life takes them. The friends truly made it the best 5 years of my life. They somehow made the toughest studying and most mundance courses a fun time. How do I make sure they know just how much impact they have had on my life and just how much I appreciate each and every one of them.

I hope to capture all our best undergrad memories, however, difficult it is to put into words/ a video. The pain I feel from thinking about letting it all go and from having to say goodbye to my people proves how deep a connection was made. As difficult as it was to say goodbye to all my most treasured friends today and watch it sink in that the bonfire is likely the last occasion where every single one of us will be in the same place again, I am confident that this is not the last I will see of them. I'm so excited to see everyone achieve all their goals and dreams and keep in touch with them.

I cannot wait for the excitement of "something new" to hit after the sadness sinks in and passes. As sad as it is that an incredibly sweet and fun chapter of our lives are ending, the new chapter that is starting is equally as exciting. It will be more responsibiliity, more hardships, and more stress, etc, but with every low there must be an equal and opposite high.

I am looking forward to seeing all my smart, gifted friends achieve everything they dream of. I can't wait to see where everyone ends up and what path they decide to take in life. I truly hope this isn't the end of many amazing friendships.
