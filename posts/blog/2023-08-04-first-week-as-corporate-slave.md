title: First week at the new job reflection
date: '2023-08-04'

The best word to describe the first week of my first real job is: grateful

## So lucky
I've always been hyper-aware of just how privileged I am to get to live this life. This week, the gratitude sunk in even more. I get to wake up everyday and go to work with some of the friendlist and smartest people I know. I get to continue learning and work on a super cool product that powers all of AWS which then in turn powers most of the world's technologies. I love my job. I live in an incredible, new apartment in a homey neighbourhood with my lovely brother. My loved ones are healthy and well. I am healthy and well. My biggest struggles are deciding where I should vacation next, or which hobby I should spend my free time that day doing. My friends are the funninest bunch and are always down to do fun things like start a sports team with no questions asked. The list goes on... While some small parts are purposely built as goals that I have worked towards (Eg, my job), most of it is to no credit my efforts and is just luck/ the efforts of my parents. 

I'm excited to continue taking all that has been given to me to build my dream life in this next chapter in life. As well, I want to carry forward the gratitude and reflect on how I can spend my efforts to giving back to those that deserve credit and how I can carry it forward to setup other lives for success. 

## More feelings
I think even though a lot of this definitely is an internal struggle, I do feel a lot more respected and a lot less imposter syndrome than when I worked as an intern. Maybe it's my new teammates or maybe it's all in my head, but I definitely believe that everyone is doing their best to make sure I am set up for success. Everyone has been so welcome and helpful during my first week of onboarding that I never felt out of place. I'm super excited to grow to be an integral part of the team. I genuinely feel like I belong (with fellow nerds and smartasses) contrary to what most first week on the jobs should feel like. I was barely even nervous on my first day and that says a lot from a chronically anxious person. It was so exciting to meet everyone and get to work in office for the first time. 

## Career wise
Questions like "corporate vs startup" or "new team vs old team" were always thrown around before graduation, and I've always had my go to answers, but now after a week of being on a team whose product has been around for two decades and is integral to all of AWS versus interning on an up and coming team that was developing a new product from scratch, I think I finally have a solid answer. After just one short week of being on this new team and talking to everyone, receiving advice from the newer and older engineers, I realize the amount of things I have to learn. Both technical wise and soft skills wise, I have just been absorbing as much of the information that has been thrown at me. And it's looking like my onboarding will last another 6 months. What a privilege that my job is literally to learn from the friendliest people about one of the most integral products at AWS. I think under corporate, the correct order definitely goes old team -> new team. Especially joining as a fresh new grad, I'm just excited to be learning and on this two decade old team there is so so much I can learn. Until I learn everything (which some of the oldest engineers on my team claim to not have achieved either) or get bored I am super excited to be learning and contributing to this new team I get to call mine. Only then would I want to consider switching to a new team or startup for an opportunity to apply all that I have learnt and be a part of the decision process for building not only a product from scratch but also a team/ work environment that works. 

## Discipline
One thing that i've learnt is the importance of discipline, especially towards getting enough sleep. Having to be the first person to call it a night is difficult in the moment but pays off when you have enough energy to focus and be yourself the day after. Balance is key. Some things come easier than others. For example, it's pretty easy for me to pack lunch everyday instead of eating out but it is much harder to motivate me to go for a run after coming home from a long work day. At work, discipline also drives progress. Especially in teams like ours where noone checks in if your stuck and meetings become optional if you are justifiably busy, the lack of micromanaging amplifies the effects of self discipline. It truly is a choice how much effort I want to put in to learning and onboarding our products. And right now I think I'm at an excellent level, clocking at least 6-7 productive hours every work day. 

## When the novelty is lost
Update: we are now on week 4. The one month mark is approaching quickly. Today, the Monday Blues really hit me. I was super tired, low energy, and needed some help from coffee to keep me focused. I had a feeling the motivation would slowly dwindle as I grow more familiar with the team, the workplace, and the technologies. It's a work in progress to build a sustainable routine - to know what my limits are and how much work is enough. Today, I really felt the novelty wearing off (likely because the team is getting used to me :-) plus they were probably drained from chasing deadlines all week). But this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just means I am slowly transitioning into a new phase where novelty is being traded for comfort. 

## Goals
- To catch up to the rest of the team: I believe I have the capability to be at an equal level as my coworkers if I study hard and put in the hours. I want to be able to contribute to discussions, review other's code, and have enough understanding to debate and disagree. 
- To stay healthy: I'm in a place where I have a lot more time and energy to give to my job when compared to coworkers with kids, long commutes, etc. But what I am not willing to give in to get ahead at my job is my health (mental and physical). I want enough energy at the end of the day/ on the weekend to train for a marathon should I choose to. If I am having a bad day and want to chill or play game or go shopping, I will give myself the luxury to. 
- To become an efficient programmer
    - learn keybinds for Vim
    - let go of perfectionism as a trade off for higher efficiency
    - think about big picture impact, scalability, readability, conciseness, and clarity
    - know when to ask questions and reach out for help
