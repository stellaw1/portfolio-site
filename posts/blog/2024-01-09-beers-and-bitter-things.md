2023 was a truly unforgettable year. It was the year we graduated. We travelled to four new countries/ cities (Mexico, Korea, Japan, & San Francisco), went to so many concerts (Valley, TWICE, Ed Sheeran, & Coldplay), partied with friends (new & old), learnt new sports (and climbed to intramural champions btw). So much happened this year. It was a year full of doing, and not a lot of reflecting which I think will be the opposite of how 2024 will play out. 

2024 is the year of the dragon and I foresee it will be the year we really feel like we are **growing old**. This feeling hit me recently in a candid conversation with some friends, when friend A admitted that she recently started enjoying beer and friend B responded, "isn't that just the adulting thing where you start to appreciate bitter things?"

We are well underway in this chapter we call adulthood and things are slowly settling into routine. Everyone is working hard to build their dream life. Some of us are getting married while others are going full steam ahead on the career path. Everyone is venturing out into different paths and they are all equally exciting. This year will tell a lot and I can't wait to find out what it has in check for us all. So much change happened last year that I wonder if 2024 will match or be a little more calm. The possibilities are endless!

### Some goals that I want to accomplish this year:
 - save up $100,000
 - run a full marathon

### Some goals that I will work towards but will most likely accomplish next year:
 - pay off my student loans
 - get promoted to L5

### Some things I want to do more this year:
 - Be kinder (to others and to myself)
 - Read
 - Travel

## Mantra of the year:
> Do it afraid. 

An evolution from last year's "Don't let fear hold you back". I really want to focus on leaning into discomfort and finding confidence through that.
