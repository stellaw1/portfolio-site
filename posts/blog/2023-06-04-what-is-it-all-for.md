Currently on a flight to Korea with the friendos, ready to celebrate our grad with travelling, after a busy week surrounded by my favourtie people. 


## Twenties era
The fact that I'm 23 years old and graduated is slowly settling in. I may never be a student again and the beginning of the rest of my life is starting whether I like it or not. My twenties is well underway. This is where I get to make decisions that will affect the rest of my life. It is abslutely terrifying; I'm so afraid of making a mistake that has lasting consequences. 

## Who is it all for
Watching Ticket to Paradise, starring Julia Roberts and George Clooney made me miss my parents. It reminded me of one of my many life goals. There are countless things I am grateful for in this most precious life I get to live, but one thing that I selfishly want to get to have in my life, is for my parents to watch me get married. Everyone's family dynamic is a little different and ours is especially hard to explain. My parents sacrificed more than life for my brother and I to get to live this privileged life we live, and all they ask for in return is for us to live a good, long, happy life. They have never asked for anything in return. Needless to say, it is a big part of my life goal to get to spoil them and take care of them in return, as they grow old. I'm excited to get to do just that as I start making my own money. On top of that, there are a lot of experiences that they did not get to live out (because of generation differences, money worries, etc) and that is something I hope I can give them sooner rather than later. I want to take them to see new places and visit countries they have not been to before. I want them to meet all my wonderful friends. I want to go on walks and try different sports with them. I want them to live through my twenties alongside me, and also get to witness the next stage in my life where I get to start my own family and pass on all that I have learnt from them. At that point, it almost feels like a final checkpoint in parenthood - their job complete. 

It is a weird feeling when ironically the best way to give back to your parents is to live your best life. It sometimes feels selfish and wrong, , but all I can do is try my best to treat them like kings and queens, as they have for my brother and I. 

This next phase of life is terrifying and will most likely be messy, but I am also super excited to inch closer to all the life goals that I have set and to explore more to be added to the list. 

## No need for perfection
Recently I saw a clip on Instagram that explained that if we assume we entered adulthood at the age of 19, then we are really only 4 year old adults at the age of 23. Hearing that made the pressure a little lighter. The precise balance that we are all chasing of every priority and goal is eternally hard to juggle. It is impossible to live a perfect life where every priority is satisfied, especially because of the fallacy that whenever a goal is achieved we continue to seek bigger, better things. We need a constant reminder to enjoy the journey as we chase. As messy and imperfect as it is, such is life.
