title: Turning 23 in Mexico

This year I was lucky enough to spend my birthday celebrating in Cancun, Mexico with some of my best friends. It was part of a grad trip with my friend group, DJ CARS (an acronym of all our names combined). This trip almost did not make it out of the group chat, and despite a few unforeseen tragedies, I'm very glad we got to celebrate and have a fun time together. Although this year, the DJ CARS friend group drifted slightly apart, it has become a tradition for all of us to take a trip together somewhere every summer. Previously, we have done roadtrips to Kelowna, Banff, camping trips to Nanaimo, and I'm excited for what next year's trip will be! It was super nice to catch up with everyone while enjoying the sunshine (getting burnt and getting drunk together). This trip really made the friendships feel like family status because we can still feel really close to each other without having to see each other every day. 

Excited for what's to come for each meber of DJ CARS and for the dynamic of the friend group altogether.

Reflecting back, I was getting a bit sad that I didn't get to celebrate my birthday with a cake with my family, but that's okay! Traditions are what you make of them. 

23 really feels like a milestone age, maybe because the timeline matches perfectly with graduation marking the end of an era. My friends that have already turned 23 and I keep joking about how our bones are weak and body is fragile now, compared to the rest of our friends who are still 22.
