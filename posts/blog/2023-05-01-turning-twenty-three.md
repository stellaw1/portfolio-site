This year I was lucky enough to spend my birthday celebrating in Cancun, Mexico with some of my best friends. It was technically a grad trip with my university friend group, DJ CARS (an acronym of all our names combined). This trip almost did not make it out of the group chat and, despite a few unforeseen tragedies, I'm very glad we got to celebrate and have a fun time together. Although this year, the DJ CARS friend group drifted slightly apart, it has become a tradition for all of us to take a trip together somewhere every summer. Previously, we have done roadtrips to Kelowna, Banff, camping trips to Nanaimo, and I'm excited for what next year's trip will be! It was super nice to catch up with everyone while enjoying the sunshine (getting burnt and getting drunk together). I was a bit sad that I didn't get to celebrate my birthday with a cake with my family, but that's okay! DJ CARS is my dysfunctional secondary family <3
