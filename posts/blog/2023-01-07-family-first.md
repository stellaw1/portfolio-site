title: Family is my everthing

My heart is so full after getting to see so many family members after 3+ years. I even got to meet my two nieces for the first time. It felt like there was a fragment of my heart missing that can only be filled by eating and laughing with my precious family. We actually have a huge and very complicated family tree. Because my mom and her mom both had 7 siblings, we actually have an imeasurable number of second cousins because we lost touch with some family. The farthest distanced second cousin that we do keep in touch with we actually got to visit and stay with in New York this year :D There also ends up being large age gaps between cousins and therefore strange age gaps between generations that should be considered their elders but are only older by 2 years old. For example, the nieces I met today call the youngest cousins who are only older than them by 2 years uncle and auntie.
