> How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard. 


## Too many goodbyes
I have for sure reached my quota for goodbyes this summer - sending some of my closest friends off to their next chapter in life, saying farewell to my freedom as adulthood approaches, and leaving my student identity behind forever. It even feels like I have had to say goodbye to versions of loved ones that are still around with the amount of change that is happening all around. Whether because they are getting into relationships, shifitng priorities, diving into work, or are planning to move away, etc. This is easily the hardest transition period I have experienced in my life so far. 

It's weird because everytime I go through a hard goodbye, I have this fleeting thought that I will never let myself get close to people again. And everytime I fail this form of self defense. Sometimes I grow attached to people so gradually that I don't even realize, while other times I choose to suffer the consequences. By now I have also learnt to appreciate just how bad it hurts because it goes to show how good the good parts were. Forever and always, I will continue to choose people. I would sacrifice a lot for the joy and memories that I got to share with those I love the most. 

Naturally, when people move away, as they get busy with this new life and as priorities change, some friendships I have to learn to let go. All I can do is hope that they are living their best life and root for them silently. On the other hand, I have also been talking to other friends that moved away more - us learing to text better, call frequently, and resort to the remote social activities that we know best from the covid days. It will be very interesting to see all of these long distance friendships play out. 

## Best summer ever 
The past few months - aka the summer post graduation - have truly been a blast. I got to visit many new places, connect with new friends, and catch up with old ones. It was the best summer spent with only one goal to have the most fun before succumbing to the corporate life. The memories that were formed will last a lifetime and hopefully serve as fuel to get through the days leading up to the next vacation.
