There's always a strange feeling associated with July. It marks the official midpoint of the year/ of the summer and always passes by extra fast. For me, it was extra special this year because I got to travel to SF, reunite with my childhood besties and run my first marathon with my brother. 

## The marathon
When they say the marathon is just the celebration, they really weren't lying. The actual race was easier than expected and way more enjoyable. Everything seemed to line up on race day for us - the weather was perfect for running even though it was freezing and raining the few days before. The traffic and race start were some of the smoothest I've ever seen, although this may have been because there were fewer runners than expected as well. Let's recap everything from the start. 

For this, we have to rewind back a few months, to Christmas 2023, when we decided to spontaneously sign up for the marathon without knowing much about it. At the time, we were still basking in the holiday energy, letting ourselves have that extra treat and extra rest day, telling ourselves training will start in January. And, it did. By the New Year, we started incorporating running into our weekly routines. At this point, I still knew nothing about running attire, fuel, nutrition, schedules, types of runs, etc. We just went on our silly little runs three times a week and made a silly little goal to the long run of the week by 1 km every following week such that 42km lined up with the week of the race on July 28th. And this routine took us all the way to spring which is when life got a little busier. We had travel plans so a few weeks were spent away from home, work got busy and I started on call which shackled me to my home where my computer and internet access is so no long runs on those weeks either. During this time my algorithm also found its way to runner tok, where I learned more about gels and the different types of runs we should train, such as speed intervals, tempo runs, hill sprints, and even weight lifting. This is the point where my wallet took a hit because I also splurged on new Hoka's for the race, but it helped get me excited for more runs and more long runs to come. On April 21, we also did the Sun Run which is a 10k race in Vancouver. This was really fun and we both beat our PB even though it was super crowded and our intention was just for fun. Then, the runs gradually increased in mileage. On April 28 we accidentally broke 26 and on May 20 we intentionally broke 30. We tried to start a run club, but noone wanted to join (so weird). I even ventured out to an organized run club where we did intervals. Some runs became easier while others became tougher. The weather also started warming up to the point where we nearly got heatstroke during a couple long runs where we didn't start early enough. Some friends joined in on a few runs here and there but through it all Ian was the most consistent run partner. We would run almost all of our weekend long runs together and do shorter runs on our own throughout the week just because of our opposite schedules. It worked out very well. Also throughout this whole time I was teeter tottering between believing I could finish the race and thinking I would DNF. I remembering watching a bunch of marathon vlogs of some of my favourite fitness youtubers complete their first marathons and sobbing while watching. Even if you ask me now why it got so emotional, I don't think I could give you a proper answer. Anyways, back to the story, soon it became time to taper. At this point, we were just excited to have our weekends back and to catch a break (the runs were getting really hard especially due to the heat). The excitement of visiting SF also started to seep in, but there was one last push. To adjust for the 5 am start time, I essentially flipped my entire routine for the last 2 weeks after we started tapering, starting with 7 am wakeup, to 6 am and eventually to 5 am. Ian gave up halfway and chose to keep his social life haha but I tried my best to stay disciplined. To be real, these two weeks were quite miserable... I essentially did not go out or make any plans and was quite drained on more than a few of the days (our genes did not set us up to succeed as morning people). My boyfriend who has probably the worst sleep schedule known to man was super supportive and woke up with me everyday just to say good morning and check that I was up. 

Fast forwarding a bit, we land in SF and try our best to adjust to the habitat there. We picked up our race packets and met up with friends aka our cheer squad.

We did a couple touristy things as well and walked a few thousand too many steps than recommended, but we did stick to our early bed times. I was getting really excited now, reminiscing on everything that we've accomplished thus far even if I DNF, it was a fun challenge and a sweet memory to have all my best friends there with me. On July 28th aka race day, we successfully woke up early (neither of us really slept), ate our hearty breakfast and caught our Uber to the start line. The crowd was much smaller than I expected but this became a good thing - it helped with my nerves and allowed us a smooth start. We saw Angelo (a fellow runner) and Marco (number one cheer squad) at the start line but quickly separated to start the trek!

I kid you not, 10 meters into the race I felt the first wave of emotions hit me. I think it was a combination of seeing Marco working so hard to come cheer us on, relief that Ian decided to run with me, and a bit of dread for the longest run ahead haha. I sucked those tears back in real quick, telling myself I'd save it for the finish line. The first half was super enjoyable and went smooth as expected. The weather was perfect, not too hot and not too cold, barely any wind and no fog so we could see the views of the bridge and the waters. We found our random pacers in the crowd running with us - one was wearing a pink tutu and another said Jia You to us! Even through the crazy ups and down hills (literally) across the bridge, we were feeling good. Legs were loose, breaths were full, and body was hydrated.

After crossing back to this side of the bridge we saw the first marco appearance!! and then the race started getting harder. There were even more uphills and a lady in the sideline that lied to us saying "downhill ahead" when there were only more uphills... Our little walks after grabbing water got a little longer but we didn't take our first real break until reaching GG park. The break was short though because we saw the 4:50 pacer group and said to each other we have to run. The pacers helped a lot because this was one of the hardest parts of the race. We were just under the 30 km mark and started feeling the need to dig deep to keep the legs moving.

Running with the pacers gave us a little break to turn our brains off for a minute. Then, we got another Marco appearance! He even pulled me for 2 meters and gave me a little kiss as a boost. He also told us that he's going to find one more spot to meet us and then after that it'll be at the finish line. This segment was definitely the hardest part of the entire race. Ian started getting really tired too also because the sun came out and the weather turned really hot. I remember a few intersections where the crowd was specifically chanting at us to keep going while we took our walk breaks. My mindset at this point was a repeat of the pattern "just get to mile 20" then you can take a break... "just get to mile 22" then you only have 5 km left (the math of converting miles to something I understand was also a fun little distraction even though i think the math was completely wrong lol). At mile 24, I told myself I have to keep running until I see marco and then I'll take a break because after that I'll soon reach the point where I can see Bay Bridge and Angelo told me after you can see Bay Bridge it's all smooth sailing from there (Bay Bridge marks the finish line). However, Ian started dying at this point and kept telling me to keep going without him. I really really wanted to cross the finish line with him afterall we made it so far together already. The dilemma carried me for another mile, thinking about what I should do. I had a bit of energy left in me after eating a gel and was really determined to have the run end sooner rather than later. In the end, I did keep running while he started walking a bit more. The seeing Marco motivation was really carrying me, even though I ended up not seeing him again until the finish line due to a series of unfortunate events, but this somehow worked out as the final motivation that carried me there. Within this final period, I nearly cried 5 times but took deep breaths to not let the tears fall each time. I almost sobbed after separating from Ian and again right before seeing the finish line.

Everything my dad told me was true, all the tips he gave me and his predictions on how I would feel, where I would gain energy and where I would slow down etc were all spot on. Even Ian's predictions were correct - he said I overestimated, would beat his time, and would cry at the finish line. I guess there are some things that you just can't understand until you try it for youself. It was one of the coolest experiences and such a privilege that I'm able to participate in something like a marathon AND have such supportive friends that they come out just to watch me cross the finish line. Everyone keeps telling me what a huge accomplishment I achieved, but I'm not sure if I would call it an accomplishment. It's cool that my body can do that and especially cool that it can 2 years after breaking my right leg. But the real accomplishment is the 6+ months of time and effort that we put into training even on the days that we didn't want to. Honestly, every able bodied person with enough discipline could do it too, but it is a cool thing to join the club and be able to say I've ran a marathon.

It's been about a week now and it feels weird not having to dedicate my weekends to training anymore. It feels weird to think that we really did that and it's all over... until the next marathon :^) I'm not super sure where I will take my running journey next to be honest. My legs are still sore and I don't have the capacity to think about the next race just yet, but I am pretty confident that there will be more to come :) We will just have to wait and see. For now, relishing in the fact that we did that!! and getting a bit of needed rest and reset.
