This was the first year of my life that I spent the entirety of working full time. 2023 was the transition from being a full time student to full time worker and 2024 was the first full year spent working full time. I had a hard time in the beginning of the year accepting that this is how my life will look like for the next 30-40 years. Some days you wake up dreading work and others it is tolerable. It felt so doomed accepting the fact that the majority of my time is now dedicated to something that is not necessarily at the top of my to do list. While I have goals in terms of my career, it felt imbalanced how much time it took and how much time it was taking away from my other ambitions. At times it felt like I was drowning and completely lost on what to do / how to find my way. Eventually, I found a routine and a balance that worked for me and now there are things that I‚Äôm actually really excited about. 


## First let‚Äôs recap
It was another year full of travel, running, sports, love, and work. 

I got to explore a lot of new places: 
- Went skiing at Whistler for the first time with uni friends
- Lots of sf visits in the beginning half of the year
- Took mom to visit Montreal + Toronto with Ian and Jun
- Explored the mountain and island during October Taiwan trip
- Seattle with friends
- Toronto with more friends
- Hawaii with bestie
- Japan with da fam

I was travelling so much during the later half of the year that I got major travel fatigue by the time new years came around... Oh well no regrets! I kept telling myself gotta fit in the travels before rto5 hits next year! But let's be real we will probably be equally if not more adventurous regardless of how many days we have to badge in to the office :^)

## Other fun things
- cat sit momo
- met new members of the family aka my nieces and nephews who live overseas. The cousins quite literally live the farthest possible distance away from each other... One is from Germany, one lives in New Zealand, and us in Canada. We all flew to Taiwan and they brought their children. It was quite an iconic meetup!
- Learnt new sports: ulti, golf, pickleball, bouldering, tennis 
- I spent tons of time running/ training and ran a marathon in July! Sun run was also so fun that we decided to create a team next year ([join our team](https://partiful.com/e/YQff5Nr6anG9t25cPOZc)! You‚Äôll get a shirt that says :3 on the back) 
- Tried to join a run club
- Tried to start a run club 
- Some cries during LDR and countless fun dates w my love 
- Many bad days of work and on call made up for by fun team lunches and praise on achievements
- turned 24 with an epic Walle and Eve cake. It was a mellow celebration but surrounded by my loved ones ü•∞ Perfectly what I had in mind
- Started watching hockey (blame Marco) (rip Canucks) 
- Went through some changes with our team/ org/ management at work which at one point felt so doomed but is now looking up 
- Not as many concerts as last year but saw the orchestra in a park with anica to celebrate her birth. Also candlelight concert and Shawn Mendes
- Threw parties ([Beta Bonanza Bash](https://partiful.com/e/bMTQBgkFwLESElbGV1JC)) and attended parties (Ulti celebrations, Anica's [iconic house party](https://partiful.com/e/sDyiKZUS44rDqFtTkYXx) ft. tft party crew) 

In the end, lots of new memories were made and lots of new experiences gained. I was panicking about not having enough time to live my life outside of having a 9-5 but it‚Äôs safe to say I had a very fulfilling year with no regrets left behind. Looking forward to carrying over all the lessons learnt from this year and to grow even more next year. It feels like every year we say ‚Äútime flies‚Äù but it truly feels like with each year that passes time somehow speeds up even more?? Whether it‚Äôs due to realizing there are bigger better things you want to achieve or because we learn more about the things that we don‚Äôt know... Everytime I hear an update about a friend or from a friend it reaffirms the realization that life waits for no one. It is a very exciting thing though, seeing everyone live out their lives and how all their decisions play out. Last year's motto was ‚Äúdo it afraid‚Äù. I think I somewhat lived up to that? I signed up for a marathon, did the marathon, pushed myself to step out of my comfort zone at work, had difficult conversations w my partner, and said no to things to put myself first (very scary for a chronic people pleaser). I embarrassed myself trying new sports and asking dumb questions. In turn, I improved a lot and discovered new topics to be curious about. This year's motto is a single word: "peace". Very straight forward, this year I am manifesting peace for myself. I've always had pretty bad anxiety (a superpower that can help you achieve a lot by using stress as a motivation) but realized last year that I have a difficult time relaxing, even on vacation for example when a break is well deserved. As many others do, I suffer from "never enough syndrome" and basically need every single thing in my life to be perfect for me to be able to take a breather :-) A very unhealthy fallacy but also one that is very hard to overcome in an instant. Therefore, I am entering this year with the mentality of slowing down and being happy with just enough üòá We don't need to be the best and we don't need to be perfect. I just want to live a simple, happy life that is sustainable and meaningful, surrounded by my loved ones.
