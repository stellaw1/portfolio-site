So this is my twenties...


Sometimes I feel like it will never sink in that I'm 22 years old; sometimes I feel like I have experienced 50 years of life already because life moves so fast. So much growth and change has happened in my life and in those around me. 

This is such an exciting time of our lives. Everyone is doing their best and living the lives that they dreamed of. Whether its building their dream career, meeting their ideal significant other, or moving to their dream city. Everyone is working hard to build the lives that they are content with. Everyone is finding theirselves and finding the poeple they want around. Some are building their personality while others are building their dream home or planning their dream wedding already. Everyone is at different places going at different paces. And that's such a scary but exciting thing. Most of us have no big responsibilities and have the luxury of making selfish decisions prioritizing ourselves. 

So what do I want to do with my life? That is the question that haunts us all. Now is the time to be saving money but also be travelling the world because you gotta live while you're young (but also like how am i supposed to afford a house if I don't start saving up now while I have no responsibilities) ANYWAYS there's a lot of doubt and confusion in this age but alos a lot of excitement!! We are all just doing our best, enjoying our time. 

Some concrete goals that I have set that almost act like pillars for how I wish to navigate my twenties: 
- career: work hard, climb the ladder, and don't lose my personality along the way! Balance is key
- family: treasure them, spoil them, spend time with them, make sure they know how much I love and appreciate them
- friends: experience and make memories! Appreciate the time that we have together knowing 
- relationship: not trying to force anything because might as well be single if being with someone else isn't going to add to my life, but also be fearless and put yourself out there because how else are you going to meet anyone
- hobbies: celebrate creativity and learning new things! These are the things that make up your personality and help build connections with others. 

I think one good rule of guidance is to ask yourself: if you had no responsibilities and had no worries for money/ making a living etc, what would you do with your life? For example, for me, I would love to either read all the books in the world or try to see every animal that exists in the world like a pokemon trainer checking off each species in my pokedex. It's all a balance right. Some days I work really hard and am staring at a computer screen from the moment I wake up to the AMs, but I do that so that in my time off I have the finances to experience everything I wish to with the people that I love. 

Honestly living in your twenties is a very fine balance of a plethera of things to balance. It is a series of decisions that have short term and long term effects on your life. For those that choose to put for time/ effort/ money into investing for an easier life in the future (whether in terms of finances, real estate, or otherwise) that just means they have to work a little harder than others now and make more sacrifices for that. Versus those that are living it up and spending every last dollar of their paycheck now are making great memories at a time where their mind and body are at the peak. There is no wrong way to live your twenties. Everyone gets to live it however they want. We all have ups and downs and can't help compare sometimes, but we really need to be confident in our decisions and our lives. Let go of the idea that we need to live a perfect life by achieving X by Y years old. Let go of the mindset that we can only find happiness if we have X, Y and Z. I have accepted that there is no "perfect balance" or "permanent happiness". Every decision you make is a good one and every mistake you make is a good lesson to do better next time. So just be happy with the way life is :) be happy with the poor decisions you have made along the way. Be happy with the embarrassing moments or time wasted on shitty people. These were all lessons learnt for a better life. Stop standing around complaining about things that are in your control and do something to change the things you hate for the better. Stop waiting for the perfect time to learn that new hobby that you've always wanted to try but "never had the time". Go out and experience all the good and bads of the world and grow as much as you can while you still can. Meet all the people you have the pleasure of getting to know their stories. Actively listen to what they say and spread the lessons you have learnt along the way to them! 

What I want to see from myself before I graduate : 
- Give as much effort as you are willing to to schoolwork and soak up what you can about interesting topics that courses are offering you 
- say yes! to the new activiites, to the new people, and to the new places
- Health: prioritize this before it's too late. Take care of your posture, taking breaks, me days, and use marathon training and intramurals as a good excuse to keep up with fitness
- Make the first move, ask the deep questions, talk about feelings and goals and controversial topics that make friends uncomfy. Take these relationships to the next level - FEARLESS!!!
- Learn! Learn anything and everything. Dig into the things that interest you and work on projects that you are passionate about. Please do not every let your brain go dormant. Now is the time where you can put your time and effort into learning the things you want to rather than having to spend all of your time on schoolwork that might have seemed pointless. 
- Express creativity! How can you spice up videos/ storytelling to express how you feel/ what you want to say/ spread

So like I don't really know what I want to say. All I know is that it's important to try to group thoughts into words and to document this process of figuring out life :D Life is good! far from perfect but it's good! and it's fine if it's not good because we will work hard to make it good!
