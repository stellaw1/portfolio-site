## New years resolution
It feels like everytime I visit Taiwan, I comeback as a new person. Maybe because being around family members that know me well and watched me grow up helps me realize how much growth happens in the time that I spend away from them. I always find myself reflecting on my perspective, my lifestyle, and how I can improve as a person during my time in Taiwan (maybe that's also cause everytime I visit I am on break and finally have a chance to clear my mind lol) 

I'm an avid hater of new years resolutions, specifically my pet peeve is when people say they want to build a certain habit/ achieve a certain goal and feel the need to wait till the new years to start acting on it. I hate this type of procrastination any time of the year tbh... And I don't claim to be above it, I certainly suffer from the same fallacy, often and constantly. I digress. The new years is definitely a clean new beginning to kick start a new habit or goal that has been on the backlog, and through reading Atomic Habits (I'm currently about halfway through), I have learnt a few tips and tricks on how to build habits that last. The main points are to be specific, be realistic, and set your environment up for success while also being easy on your self and aiming for frequency/ consistency over results to begin with. 

### 1. Fitness
"I will work out more" and "I will lose x pounds" are almost always at the top of everyones list of new years resolutions. After countless times of trying that and failing to keep up after two weeks, I've learnt to tackle fitness and health goals in a different way this year (also because recovering from a broken leg forces me to take things easy hehe)

This year I have a goal to run 23 km by my 23rd birthday. I will achieve this not by tracking progress or trying to improve my pace, etc. Instead, I aim to be consistent in getting my steps in. This means I will run or walk at least 30 minutes everyday with the allowance of rest days as long as no two are taken in a row, aka at least 3 times a week. 

I will take my vitamins every morning and stretch for 10 minutes every night. 

less specific goals that I'm working on thinking of ways to enforce/ set myself up for success:
- more water, less alc
- posture check

### 2. Read
Ever since young, I've been the type of person you have to pull away from books rather than encourage to read more. BUT that only applies for fantasy or romance books that I love. Also, I have a bad habit of reading too much at once or not at all (I finished the last 3 books of Harry Potter within a week after taking a 5 month hiatus after Goblet of Fire). Therefore, to encourage reading more self help/ educational/ and classic books that are a little tougher to read, I will read 1 chapter every night before bed. 

### 3. Productivity
The biggest bad habit I am trying to break is scrolling mindlessly on instagram for an hour or two in bed right after waking up. I will break this habit by avoiding checking my phone first thing in the morning by setting my phone far away from my bedside table such that I need to get up to fetch it and hide Instagram from the homepage of my phone and turn off notifications. 

I'd also like to learn some new technologies (WIP)
- monthly blog reflection
- tickets on personal site
- personal projects

### 4. Sustainability
- less materialistic
- save money
- invest in staple pieces


PS. why is it so hard to convey thoughts into concrete words
