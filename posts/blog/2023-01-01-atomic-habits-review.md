## New years resolution

It feels like everytime I visit Taiwan, I come back as a new person. Maybe being around family members that know me well and watched me grow up helps me realize how much growth happens in the time that I spend away from them. I always find myself reflecting on my perspective, my lifestyle, and how I can improve as a person during my time in Taiwan (maybe also because everytime I visit I am on break and finally have a chance to clear my mind)

I'm an avid hater of new years resolutions for two reasons. One, we shouldn't wait until a certain date to begin building habits or chasing goals. And two, new years resolutions imply that there exists specific criteria for goals to be classified as "achieved." When in reality, healthy habits need to be built into your ever changing lifestyle and should constantly be prioritized. It's not as if achieveing a resolution of going to the gym everyday this year lets you off the hook to forget fitness the year after. Below are just a few goals I have set for myself after reading Atomic Habits and have been working on recently. It's important to remind myself not to set too many goals and too far fetched goals at one time. As one goal becomes habit and easier to keep up with then I will continue to set new ones that I want to incorporate into my daily life.

### 1. Fitness/ Health

This year I have a goal to run 23 km by my 23rd birthday. I will achieve this not by tracking progress or trying to improve my pace, etc. Instead, I aim to be consistent in getting my steps in. This means I will run or walk at least 30 minutes everyday with the allowance of rest days as long as no two are taken in a row, aka at least 3 runs/ walks every week. Since I don't have classes on Tuesdays or Thursdays, I will take these mornings to have a coffee and get outside (or head to the gym if weather is poor)

It's also important for my posture and my recovered broken leg to stretch every day. I will stretch for 10 minutes every night before bed as part of my wind down routine.

### 2. Reading

Ever since young, I've been the type of person you have to pull away from books rather than encourage to read more. BUT that only applies for fantasy or romance books that I love. Also, I have a bad habit of reading too much at once or not at all (I finished the last 3 books of Harry Potter within a week after a 5 month hiatus after Goblet of Fire). Therefore, to encourage reading more self help/ educational/ and classic books that are a little tougher to finish, I will read 1 chapter every day either on my commute to school or before bed as part of my wind down routine.

### 3. Productivity

The biggest bad habit I am trying to break is scrolling mindlessly on instagram for an hour or two in bed right after waking up. I will break this habit by avoiding checking my phone first thing in the morning by setting my phone far away from my bedside table such that I need to get up to fetch it. I also hid Instagram from the homepage of my phone and turned off notifications.

I will track the three habits described above in a habit journal. Everything else - dreams, travel goals, ambitions, and things to manifest this year - will belong in my 2023 vision board to avoid cluttering my habit building goals with too much at once and serve as a better way to constantly inspire.
